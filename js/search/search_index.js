structure:\n[\n  {\n    library: \"Custom Library\",\n    imports: {\n      className: InputClassComponent,\n    },\n  },\n];In the above configuration,'library' should be the library name .'Imports' is an object of key-value pair where key is the componentName it's value should be the actual component.\nYou can prepare as many of an array of objects of library and imports as the following\n[\n  {\n    library: \"Neutrinos Library1\",\n    imports: {\n      \"InputClassComponent1\": InputClassComponent1,\n    },\n  },\n   {\n    library: \"Neutrinos Library2\",\n    imports: {\n
