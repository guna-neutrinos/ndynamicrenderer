structured\nInstallation\n$ npm install n-dynamic-renderer\nUsage\nDownload the Case Manager UI Renderer from the story\n\n\nOpen 'Manage Plugins'->Add Dependency->Enter Package Name,Version,Angular Package, Library name, Module Name and checkon the forRoot() and click on the + button to add the module.\n\n\nCreate a legacy service \n\nPass the libraryname and its components installed in the applications by preparing the following structure:\n[\n  {\n    library: \"Custom Library\",\n    imports: {\n      className: InputClassComponent,\n    },\n  },\n];In the above configuration,'library' should be the library name .'Imports' is an object of key-value pair where key is the componentName it's value should be the actual component.\nYou can prepare as many of an array of objects of library and imports as the following\n[\n  {\n    library: \"Neutrinos Library1\",\n    imports: {\n      \"InputClassComponent1\": InputClassComponent1,\n    },\n  },\n   {\n

HomePageComponent\n    },\n  },\n];The above configuration can be passed to the library as the following:\n\nimport * as nComponents from 'n-components';\nimport * as inputComponent from
